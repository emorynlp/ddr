<h2 class="page-header">Overview</h2>

<p>
The <b>Deep Semantic Representations</b> (DSR) project provides guidelines for the dependency relations reflecting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_structure_and_surface_structure">deep semantics</a>.
The goal of this project is to represent sentences conveying the same semantics into one dependency structure, regardless of their surface forms.
It is an ongoing project led by the <a href="http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu">Emory NLP</a> research group.

<h3>Primary Dependencies</h3>
<p>
Primary dependencies are used to generate dependency trees preserving the following four properties: <i>single root</i>, <i>single head</i>, <i>acyclic</i>, and <i>connected</i>.
</p>

<ul><script>document.write(PRIMARY_DEPENDENCIES);</script></ul>

<h3>Secondary Dependencies</h3>
<p>
Secondary dependencies are used to generate dependency graphs containing dependency relations that are avoided from the primary dependencies to preserve the tree properties.
</p>

<ul><script>document.write(SECONDARY_DEPENDENCIES);</script></ul>
