# Deep Dependency Representation

This project provides resources for the Deep Dependency Representation (DDR) that integrates [deep structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_structure_and_surface_structure) into dependency graphs. The main objective of this project is to develop a dependency representation that is coherent across syntactic variations and gives complete predicate argument structures including non-verbal predicates as well as external arguments. The project is under the [Apache 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license and developed by the [Emory NLP](http://nlp.mathcs.emory.edu) research group.
